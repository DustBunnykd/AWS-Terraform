# AWS-Terraform
Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-Code tool that lets you define and manage AWS resources using configuration files instead of the AWS console. With Terraform, you can create, update, and delete AWS services—such as EC2 instances, VPCs, IAM roles, S3 buckets, and more—using automated, repeatable scripts.
